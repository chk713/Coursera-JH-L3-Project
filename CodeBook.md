###This data is from below below link for the Coursera course (Getting and Cleaning Data) by Johns Hopkins University.

==================================================================
This data set was obtained from above link.  This data was obtained to understand the 30 different participants with differen activities with the handheld device for understanding the sensors of the mobile device with the human activities.

The data has been previously divided into two different data sets (70% of the training and 30% of the test).  Those two data sets were combined together.  There were 30 different participants and 6 different activities which are listed below.

SUBJECT - participants (total 30)
ACTIVITY - 6 different activities
 (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING
, STANDING,6 LAYING
)

MEAN & STANDARD DEVIATION of DIFFERENT VARIABLES OF MEASUREMENTS INCLUDING
 (3-axial linear TOTAL accel, 3-axial TOTAL angular velocity, 3-axial BODY linear accel)
 **NOTE:
     TOTAL accel VS BODY accel
      IS 
     Raw data VS Filtered data which excludes gravity & body motion to measure pure body linear accel.
